This package consists of two programs: mixramp and mixramp-tag.

mixramp
=======
usage: mixramp <uncompressed_audio_file>

Audio data is read from <uncompressed_audio_file> and MixRamp tags are
written on stdout. The file format is anything that libaudiofile can
read.

The gain_analysis files are copied from the mp3gain source code.
I may change to using libreplaygain if it becomes popular.

mixramp-tag
===========
usage: mixramp-tag <compressed_audio_file> ...

MixRamp tags are written into <compressed_audio_file>.
Currently only FLAC, OGG and MP3 files are handled. FLAC files are decoded
and tagged using flac and metaflac. OGG files are decoded and tagged using 
oggdec and vorbis comment.  MP3 files are decoded and tagged using mpg123 
and eyeD3. All of these programs are assumed to be installed.

It's a script so should be simple to extend.

FLAC and OGG tags are MIXRAMP_START, MIXRAMP_END and MIXRAMP_REF.
MP3 tags are mixramp_start, mixramp_end and mixramp_ref.

MP3 tags
========
are a mess. The ones written by mixramp-tag are id3v2.4 UserTextFrame tags.
These are chosen since these are what is used for replaygain in MPD and others.
The tagger is eyeD3 and the encoding is set to utf8 so it doesn't break any
existing tags. You will have to have v2.4 tags or it will fail. eyeD3 can
convert to v2.4 with the --to-v2.4 command. Please back up your MP3 files
before you convert and add mixramp tags.
